                                        <p>It is a mountain in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. It's known for its lush greenery, diverse flora and fauna, and stunning views of the surrounding valleys.</p>

                                        <p>Its the highest peak in the Wayanad hills and one of the highest peaks in the Western Ghats, adjoining the Nilgiri Hills and Vellarimala.</p>

                                        <p>At the top of Chembra, there is a fresh water lake called 'Hridayasarassu' in the shape of heart. The blue-eyed water in the lake never dries up even in the peak of summer.</p>

                                        <p>The scenic beauty of Wayanad which is visible from the top of Chembra is very challenging and thrilling. All along the steep and slippery way to the top of the hill, the whispering of the flowing spring which sprouts from the top of the hill accompanies the tourist.</p>

                                        <p>Banasura Sagar Dam is the largest earth dam in India and second largest in Asia. It's built across the Karamanathodu River, a tributary of the Kabini River.  The Banasura project precincts are an ideal starting point for treks to the Banasura Peak. An interesting feature is a set of islands that were formed when the reservoir submerged the surrounding areas. This large expanse of water is bounded on one side with magnificent hills of heavenly charm. The dam offers breathtaking views of the Banasura mountains and picturesque surroundings. The reservoir is a popular tourist attraction. Visitors to Banasura Sagar Dam can indulge in various activities such as boating, trekking, and nature walks. There are also options for speed boating and pedal boating on the reservoir.</p>

It served as an important Jain center and a shrine during the peak of Jainism in Wayanad. Then, when Shaivism and Vaishnavism of the Hindu religion flourished, it became an important center for their activities.</p>

                                        <p>In the 18th century, when Tipu Sultan ruled the Kingdom of Mysore, he used this Jain Temple in Wayanad as the battery (ammunition store). The temple also housed some of his armies.</p>

                                        <p>The Jain Temple in Wayanad is one of the holiest sites for Jain followers in the region. It’s one of the most important medieval Jain settlements in Wayanad and around. This temple is also one of the oldest Jain temples in Kerala.</p>

                                        <p>It once served an array of purposes apart from being a religious shrine. It was also sheltering Tipu Sultan’s army in the 18th century. Today, only the temple structure remains. And it stands tall with its beams and pillars.</p>

                                        <p>This ruined Jain Temple in Wayanad is an educational and historical destination. It’s known as the Ancient Jain Temple. And it’s a symbol of the rich cultural legacy of Kerala.</p>
